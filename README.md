# DND5E Scriptlets
This module provides a few QOL features for dnd5e that don't really fit anywhere else.

## Lukas Character Sheet Filter
This provides a filter field on character sheets to filter (by name) items/spells/features.

## Lukaa Ammunition Selector.
When enabled any time a weapon with ammo is used a dialog appears prompting you to choose the ammunition to use. If there is no suitable ammunition the weapon roll is blocked. This version does not require midi-qol, just dnd5e.
