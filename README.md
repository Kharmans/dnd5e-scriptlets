# DND5E Scriptlets
This module provides a few QOL features for dnd5e that don't really fit anywhere else.

## Lukas' Ammunition Selector.
When enabled, any time a weapon with ammo is used a dialog appears prompting you to choose the ammunition to use. If there is no suitable ammunition the weapon roll is blocked. This version does not require midi-qol, just dnd5e. Enabling is a client setting so each player can choose to enable it.

## Lukas' Character Sheet Filter
This provides a filter field on character sheets to filter (by name) items/spells/features.

## Lukas' Fade Unprepared Spells
Spells that are not prpepared are faded out on display.

## Lukas' Item rarity colors.
Color item inventory lines according to the item's rarity.
